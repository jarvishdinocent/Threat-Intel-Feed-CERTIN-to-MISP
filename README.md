The Threat-Intel-Feed-CERTIN-to-MISP repository is designed to automate the process of ingesting CERT-IN's (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team) cyber threat intelligence feeds into MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform & Threat Sharing). This integration is an essential step for organizations looking to strengthen their cybersecurity posture by leveraging CERT-IN’s valuable threat data within MISP's collaborative environment.

By utilizing CERT-IN’s STIX-formatted threat intelligence, this project empowers users to seamlessly transfer threat data directly into their MISP instance. This allows organizations to improve their response strategies, enhance detection capabilities, and collaborate more effectively on the latest cyber threats.

Benefits:
⦁	Improved Threat Detection: By incorporating CERT-IN’s up-to-date intelligence into MISP, organizations can better identify emerging threats and enhance their proactive defenses.

⦁	Streamlined Collaboration: With threat data in MISP, it’s easier for security teams to collaborate globally, sharing insights into vulnerabilities, indicators of compromise (IoCs), and potential attack vectors.

⦁	Standardized Data Format: The use of STIX ensures that the data is structured and can be easily ingested into MISP or other compatible platforms.

⦁	Efficient Incident Response: With CERT-IN’s feeds, MISP users can streamline their incident response process by having access to actionable intelligence that is regularly updated.

Project Features:
⦁	Automation: This tool fetches CERT-IN threat intelligence data in STIX format and automatically integrates it into MISP, reducing the manual workload for security teams.

⦁	Data Categorization: The script extracts various types of threat intelligence including IP addresses, URLs, malware, attack patterns, and threat actors.

⦁	MISP Event Creation: Upon successful synchronization, the data is formatted into MISP-compatible events, making it easier to correlate with existing threat data.

⦁	Scheduled Updates: The script supports periodic updates, ensuring that the MISP instance receives fresh data at configurable intervals.

⦁	Compatibility: Easily configurable for different environments and scenarios, including integration with custom credentials and API keys.

How This Script Works:
⦁	The script operates by pulling threat data from the CERT-IN API and then feeding it into your MISP instance via the MISP API.

⦁	Data Fetching: The script accesses CERT-IN's publicly available threat intelligence feeds, specifically focusing on the STIX format data.

⦁	Data Parsing: It processes the incoming data to extract useful indicators such as IP addresses, hashes, and URLs.

⦁	Event Creation in MISP: Based on the fetched data, a MISP event is created and populated with the relevant indicators and metadata. This helps in organizing the threat data for later analysis or sharing.

⦁	Scheduled Synchronization: To ensure your MISP instance is always up-to-date with the latest CERT-IN feeds, you can set the script to run at regular intervals.

Additional Usage Instructions:
After setting up your environment and configuring the necessary credentials for both CERT-IN and MISP, you can run the script directly via command line. The process is automated, but you can manually trigger it as well for immediate synchronization.

For Regular Synchronization:
To set the script to run periodically (e.g., every hour), you can automate it using cron jobs or task schedulers.
